To find a sanity transaction list (just an initial substring):
    egrep -o '\d\d/\d\d/\d\d +[^ ]+' statement | sed 's/  */ /g' | sort > transaction_sanity

To run the text-to-CSV processor:
    python to_csv.py statement > q.csv

To sanity check (I iterated with this to figure out what was missing):
    # vi q.csv and then s/,"/ /
    grep -oFf transaction_sanity q.csv  | sort -u > missing
    grep -v -Ff missing transaction_sanity
The items output will be transactions missing from q.csv.  Manual editing of the Python script will be required.

The sum of the third column should match the total reported in the yearly PDF.  If it doesn't, then some transactions were omitted.
